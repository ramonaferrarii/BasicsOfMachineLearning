# Project containing **Basic Concepts of Machine Learning**

This project is done for Machine Learning Course at University of Genoa in the Robotics Engineering Bachelor's program at the University of Genoa.

## Topics:
1. *Naive Bayes Classifier*, where categorical variables are treated as numbers and then the machine learning algorithm is applied. 
2. *Linear Regression*, where the task includes 2 datasets and different approaches are considered to compare the results
3. *Evaluation of Classifiers* is an important aspect to consider when dealing with Machine Learning. The task focuses on evaluating **KNN classifier** by using *confusion matrices* and *quality indices*, such as accuracy, error rate, precision, sensitivity and F-measurement.
4. *Neural Networks* are computational models inspired by the result and the inner mechanics of brain processing.
